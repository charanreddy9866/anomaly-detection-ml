## Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that detects anomalies in network traffic using the NSL-KDD dataset. It applies feature selection techniques (ANOVA F-test & Recursive Feature Elimination) and a Decision Tree classifier for efficient and accurate attack detection.
